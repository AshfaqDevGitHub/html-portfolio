    <h1>The Best Movies According to Muhammad Ashfaq</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
    <hr />
    <h2>Munna Bhai MBBS</h2>
    <p>
      The movie Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. revolves around the importance of kindness,
      compassion, and humanity in the medical profession. The film tells the
      story of Munna, a gangster who pretends to be a doctor to fulfill his
      father's dream. Through his journey, the movie highlights the contrast
      between the rigid, impersonal nature of the medical system and the warmth
      and empathy that Munna brings to the patients. It underscores the idea
      that genuine care for others is as important, if not more so, than
      technical expertise in healing people. The film also explores themes of
      redemption, the power of love and friendship, and the transformative
      effect of doing good for others.
    </p>
    <h2>3 Idiots</h2>
    <p>
      The movie 3 Idiots centers around the themes of friendship, the pressure
      of the educational system, the pursuit of one's passion, and the
      importance of thinking creatively and differently. The film follows three
      friends—Rancho, Farhan, and Raju—during their time at a prestigious
      engineering college in India.
    </p>
    <p>
      The movie critiques the rigid and high-pressure environment of academic
      institutions, which often stifles creativity and individual thought in
      favor of rote learning and societal expectations. Rancho, the protagonist,
      encourages his friends to follow their passions rather than succumbing to
      societal pressures. The film emphasizes that success is not just about
      achieving high grades or securing prestigious jobs, but about finding
      fulfillment in what one loves to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      The movie also explores the dynamics of friendship, the struggles with
      parental expectations, and the idea that learning should be about
      understanding concepts and enjoying the process, not just memorizing facts
      to pass exams. The catchphrase "All is well" symbolizes the belief that
      facing challenges with a positive mindset can help overcome difficulties.
    </p>
    <h3>pk</h3>
    <p>
      The movie PK explores themes of religion, faith, and the search for truth.
      The film follows an alien named PK, who arrives on Earth and embarks on a
      journey to understand human behavior and the various religious practices
      he encounters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through PK's innocent and often humorous perspective, the movie critiques
      the blind faith that people sometimes place in religious rituals and the
      manipulation of faith by religious leaders. It raises questions about the
      true essence of religion, suggesting that love, compassion, and humanity
      should be the core values of any faith rather than rigid adherence to
      rituals and dogmas.
    </p>
    <p>
      PK also delves into the idea of questioning established norms and not
      accepting things at face value. PK's journey to find his lost remote (a
      metaphor for finding one's way) symbolizes the broader search for meaning
      and truth in life. The movie encourages viewers to think critically about
      societal norms, religious practices, and the importance of genuine human
      connections.
